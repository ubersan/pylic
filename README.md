# pylic - Python license checker [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/sandrochuber/pylic/blob/main/LICENSE) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pylic.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pylic/) [![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ubersan/pylic//branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ubersan/pylic/)

Reads pylic configuration in `pyproject.toml` and checks licenses of installed packages recursively.

Principles:
- Every license has to be allowed explicitly (case-insensitive comparison).
- All installed packages without a license are considered unsafe and have to be listed as such.

> Only installed packages are checked for licenses. Packages/dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` are ignored.

## Installation

```sh
pip install pylic
```

## Configuration

`pylic` needs be run in the directory where your `pyproject.toml` file is located. You can configure
- `safe_licenses`: All licenses you concider safe for usage. The string comparison is case-insensitive.
- `unsafe_packages`: If you rely on a package that does not come with a license you have to explicitly list it as such.

```toml
[tool.pylic]
safe_licenses = [
    "Apache Software License",
    "Apache License 2.0",
    "MIT License",
    "Python Software Foundation License",
    "Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)",
]
unsafe_packages = [
    "unlicensedPackage",
]
```

## Commands

`pylic` provides the following commands (also see `pylic help`):
- `check`: Checks all installed licenses.
- `list`: Lists all installed packages and their corresponding license.

## Usage Example

Create a venv to start with a clean ground and activate it

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install `pylic` and create an empty `pyproject.toml`

```sh
pip install pylic
touch pyproject.toml
```

Install all your dependencies

```sh
pip install <packageA> <packageB>
```

Run pylic

```sh
pylic check
```

The output will be similar to

```sh
Found unsafe packages:
  pkg_resources (0.0.0)
Found unsafe licenses:
  pip (18.1): MIT License
  zipp (3.4.1): MIT License
  toml (0.10.2): MIT License
  pylic (1.2.0): MIT License
  setuptools (40.8.0): MIT License
  typing-extensions (3.7.4.3): Python Software Foundation License
  importlib-metadata (3.9.0): Apache Software License
```

The return code of `pylic` is in this case non-zero due to unsafe licenses. This allows usage of pylic in CI.

```sh
echo $? # prints 1
```

As these licenses and packages are all ok we can configure `pylic` accordingly

```sh
cat <<EOT >> pyproject.toml
[tool.pylic]
safe_licenses = ["Apache Software License", "MIT License", "Python Software Foundation License"]
unsafe_packages = ["pkg_resources"]
EOT
```

After rerunning `pylic check` the output now reveals a successful validation

```sh
All licenses ok
```

Also the return code now signals that all is good

```sh
echo $? # prints 0
```

Use `pylic list` to list all installed packages and their corresponding licenses.

## Development

Required tools:
- Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/)
- GitHub cli (https://github.com/cli/cli)

Run `poetry install` to install all necessary dependencies. Checkout the `[tool.taskipy.tasks]` (see [taskipy](https://github.com/illBeRoy/taskipy)) section in the `pyproject.toml` file for utily tasks. You can run these with `poetry run task <task>`.

Creating a new release is as simple as:
- Update `version` in the pyproject.toml and the `__version__.py` file.
- `poetry run task release`.
